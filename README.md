R-vmsbase
=========

The tools you need to process, analyze, combine, integrate and
    plot your fishery data: the georeferenced dataset from the Vessel Monitoring
    System (VMS), from the Automatic Information System (AIS) or other tracking
    devices, as well as the catches or landings dataset from the Logbook or Vessel
    Register. Package 'vmsbase' is equipped by Viewer Tools to visually inspect data
    at different steps of the analyses and to produce effective outputs for reports
    and scientific publications. Viewers are conceived to show the VMS pings, to
    visualize single or multiple tracks for fishing vessels, or to represent the VMS
    data on Google Viewer, so that the user can produce easy to interpret and more
    realistic visualization of both fishing effort and effort behaviour. Package
    'vmsbase' represents the implementation of several R routines which have been
    developed by the "Tor Vergata" University of Rome Team involved in the Italian
    National Program for the Data Collection Framework for Fisheries Data between
    2009-2012.
